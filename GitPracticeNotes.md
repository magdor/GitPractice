#My Git Notes
1. **Git** is a version control tool, helps clarify especially for collaborative work. You get to see what's been changed over time, and it's logged there. It keeps a rolling log of changes and you can go backwards in time.
1. Git lives on your computer/local, accessed through the command line.
1. git **add** : starts to track changes of a particular file
1. git **commit** : adds modified files to a repository
1. **GitHub** : hosting service for git repositories, connects everyone remotely. Account must be connected with your computer to access. Version Control. Can also make/propose changes with other users' repositories. Collaboration.
1. **Markdown** : how to format text quickly and lightweight manner--more sustainable and transferrable, so you decrease the risk of losing important formatting.
1. Type **git** into command line to start interacting with it
1. **git status** checking in the command line where things are in version control.
1. **git commit** to log this version with git.
1. **git commit -m "message here"** do this all within command line.
1. **git push -u origin master** push your changes to GitHub. You will be prompted for your GitHub username and password the first time.
1. **git commit -a -m "message here"** the flag here is to add, so you don't have to do it separately again. it's combined within the commit.
